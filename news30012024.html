                    The CUHK Faculty of Arts is delighted to an nounce that Professor Feng Gangyi, from the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages, has been awarded the Collaborative Research Fund (CRF) 2023/24 Young Collaborative Research Grant (YCRG) in the amount of over HK$4.8M.

                  <strong>Research Topic and Project Summary</strong>
                  <p>
                    Language learning is critical in today's interconnected world, offering many advantages across professional, personal, and societal spheres. However, learning a new language as an adult presents substantial challenges, with varying learning difficulties and outcomes across learners. Contemporary foreign language training programs often fail to take into account the unique needs and profiles of learners, resulting in suboptimal learning processes and outcomes. With such observation, Professor Feng and his team focus the research on developing <strong>“A Predictive Personalization Approach to Enhance Foreign Language Learning and Teaching”.</strong> This project aims to 1) develop and refine language prediction models capable of forecasting individual learners’ short- to medium-term classroom-based language performance, and 2) assess the effectiveness of tailored language remediation on students with potential language learning difficulties based on the model predictions. This project has the potential to improve language learning outcomes, understand the driving factors of learning success, influence educational policies, and find practical applications in classrooms.

                  <p>
                    In sharing his thoughts, Professor Feng expressed his deep gratitude for the support provided by the Research Grants Council (RGC), emphasizing the grant as a testament to the collaborative spirit and multidisciplinary approach of the team involved. He extended his thanks to the Department, Faculty, and University for their unwavering support of young researchers and their commitment to fostering innovative research.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We invite the Faculty community to join us in congratulating Professor Feng and his team for securing this prestigious grant and wishing them success in their groundbreaking research endeavors.
